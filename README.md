    I do date it every time I edit anything though,
      I will also Update this ReadMe to highlight the updates and/or changes 

Though this document isnt finished, I figured it was in a good enough spot to release.

  I havent found a good place to post this document yet, 
    >>> recomendations are welcomed<<<


This guide discusses not only how to fully customize your flipper zero,
  but all the way up to the fundementals of electromagnetic physics
    and the emplemantation of radio frequencies in security systems.


Eventually, it will all be in this document.
    
    
  This is a document Ive put together in google docs.
    Currently anyone is able to view completely anonymously as well as make any comments. 
      The mass majority of this document is a collection of resources from other people and websites.
        Though after hearing about and purchasing (a few) Flipper Zero's i kinda went off the deep end,,,

          Thus, bringing me to the point of madness
            I had to collect as much information as I could. and i'm still at it.

Special Thanks goes to:
